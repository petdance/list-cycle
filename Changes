------------------------------------
[ENHANCEMENTS]
*   Added set_values() setter.  Thanks RJBS.
*   Constructor now takes vals=>[list] or values=>[list].
    I don't like unnecessary abbreviations, but I don't want to
    break backward compatibility.

[INTERNALS]
*   Test suite now has full test coverage.  Thanks RJBS.
